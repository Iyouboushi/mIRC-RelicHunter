Getting it set up is easy this time around assuming you unpack the zip in a good location on
your computer.  


SETUP:

 1. Do a CLEAN install to C:\RelicHunterBot\  with the complete zip package of the bot.
 2. Patch the bot to the latest versions if there are any patches.
    don't skip versions unless I specifically say it's all right.  
    ALSO NOTE: DO NOT HAVE THE BOT RUNNING WHEN YOU APPLY PATCHES!
 3. Run the mirc.exe included with Complete Package.
 4. The bot will attempt to help you get things set up.  Set the
    bot owner's nick and the IRC channel you wish to game in.  Be sure to set a 
    password for the bot that you'll register to nickserv with.
 5. (as with all mIRC programs) change the nickname and add a server
 6. Connect.
 7. Using another IRC connection as the bot owner's nick, use !new char (nick)
    without the () to get the character creation process started.
 8. Follow what the bot tells you to do.  Be sure to check out player_guide.txt as well.


Note, you do NOT have to install it to C:\RelicHunterBot\ However, it's recommended.

Patches are made when I feel there are enough errors or new 
ideas to implement that it deserves to be done.  In other words, you shouldn't 
ask when a patch will be made and released.  Just keep an eye on the website or
message board occasionally and see if I've added a topic about a patch in development 
or if there has been one released recently.

If you're a scripter who likes to play around or might want to add
something new, this section is for you.

First off, although a lot of the code is new, or improved from Kaiou's source,
there are still tons of code that could probably be rewritten and improved.

If you want to recode stuff, feel free.  I've got nothing against it.  I really
wish you luck.  If you manage to vastly improve anything, I'd love to see it.
Just send me a quick email (listed at the bottom of this document).

These are people who have helped me by helping me test, making monsters/weapons/etc,
finding bugs, or just by giving me some ideas.

If, for whatever reason, you need to contact me.. my email address is
provided:  Iyouboushi@gmail.com  or you can contact me via twitter:
twitter.com/Iyouboushi

PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, do NOT contact me about HELP
running this bot.  I seriously do not have enough time to help everyone. If
you're really having trouble, check out the message board:



You'll have to make an account (free) to post. But you're more likely to
receive help with the bot there.

HOWEVER, if you run into a serious error, DO (PLEASE) email me about the error.  
I will try to correct all errors for a later patch.  So definitely let me know
about errors.
