Once you have a pickaxe you can start digging to obtain ores. Only certain rooms allow digging, though once you're underground you can pretty much go anywhere you want.  Valid directions are: north, east, south, west, up and down.  Not all rooms allow you to dig in every direction.

Once you have a hatchet you can start chopping trees to receive wood logs. Only certain rooms allow chopping and the room will tell you how many trees are left that are available to chop.

Note that when you chop there's a 30% chance that the tree will not fall. Trees that do not fall will not give items. Also note that if your inventory is full when you chop the tree down the item will be dropped into the room, if the room is not full (if the room is full then the item simply vanishes).

!toggle flag
This command will toggle a setting on or off.  The settings are as follows:

 - Shows the "You are starving" message if your hunger gets too low.  This is set to true by default.

ShowDigSpot
 - The game will inform you if the dig command can be used in the room you're in.  This is set to false by default.

 - This will show you your POS after the room's name.  Such as:  [Void] (0:0:5)   This is set to false by default.



For these commands you can just use !toggle flag  -- you don't need to provide a on/off or true/false.  ex: !toggle ShowHunger  to turn it off. Then !toggle ShowHunger to turn it back on.
